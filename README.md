# Using the Template in GitHub Classroom

3. Students will create their own repositories based on this template.

# Setting Up Test Execution for Specified Questions

1. Ensure that the following test functions are present in `test_UnitTests.py`:
   - `test_WhoAmI()`
   - `test_getBondPrice()`
   - `test_getBondDuration()`
   - `test_GetBondPriceE()`
   - `test_GetBondPriceZ()`
   - `test_FizzBuzz()`

2. Each test function should be associated with the corresponding question and should include the point values as follows:
   - `test_WhoAmI()`: 2 points
   - `test_getBondPrice()`: 2 points
   - `test_getBondDuration()`: 2 points
   - `test_GetBondPriceE()`: 1 point
   - `test_GetBondPriceZ()`: 1 point
   - `test_FizzBuzz()`: 2 points

3. The tests will be executed automatically in GitHub Classroom, and the points for each question will be pushed to GitHub Classroom.
